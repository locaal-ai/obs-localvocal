## Introduction

LocalVocal live-streaming AI assistant plugin allows you to transcribe, locally on your machine, audio speech into text and perform various language processing functions on the text using AI / LLMs (Large Language Models). ‚úÖ No GPU required, ‚úÖ no cloud costs, ‚úÖ no network and ‚úÖ no downtime! Privacy first - all data stays on your machine.

If this free plugin has been valuable to you consider adding a ‚≠ê to this GH repo, rating it [on OBS](https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/localvocal-live-stream-ai-assistant.1769/), subscribing to [my YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@royshilk) where I post updates, and supporting my work on [GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/royshil) or [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/RoyShilkrot) üôè

For a standalone captioning and translation free open tool consider our [LexiSynth](https://github.com/occ-ai/lexisynth), which also does speech synthesis.

Internally the plugin is running a neural network ([OpenAI Whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper)) locally to predict in real time the speech and provide captions.
It's using the [Whisper.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp) project from [ggerganov](https://github.com/ggerganov) to run the Whisper network efficiently on CPUs and GPUs.

- [POST Captions to YouTube](https://youtu.be/E7HKbO6CP_c)
- [Local LLM Real-time Translation](https://youtu.be/ZMNILPWDkDw)

Current Features:
- Transcribe audio to text in real time in 100 languages
- Display captions on screen using text sources
- Send captions to a .txt or .srt file (to read by external sources or video playback) with and without aggregation option
- Sync'ed captions with OBS recording timestamps
- Send captions on a RTMP stream to e.g. YouTube, Twitch
- Bring your own Whisper model (any GGML)
- Translate captions in real time to major languages (both Whisper built-in translation as well as NMT models with [CTranslate2](https://github.com/OpenNMT/CTranslate2))
- CUDA, OpenCL, Apple Arm64, AVX & SSE acceleration support

Roadmap:
- More robust built-in translation options
- Additional output options: .vtt, .ssa, .sub, etc.
- Speaker diarization (detecting speakers in a multi-person audio stream)

Check out our other plugins:
- [Background Removal](https://github.com/occ-ai/obs-backgroundremoval) removes background from webcam without a green screen.
- [Detect](https://github.com/occ-ai/obs-detect) will detect and track >80 types of objects in real-time inside OBS
- üöß Experimental üöß [CleanStream](https://github.com/occ-ai/obs-cleanstream) for real-time filler word (uh,um) and profanity removal from live audio stream
- [URL/API Source](https://github.com/occ-ai/obs-urlsource) that allows fetching live data from an API and displaying it in OBS.
- [Polyglot](https://github.com/occ-ai/obs-polyglot) translation AI plugin for real-time, local translation to hunderds of languages

## Download
Check out the [latest releases](https://github.com/occ-ai/obs-localvocal/releases) for downloads and install instructions.

### Models
The plugin ships with the Tiny.en model, and will autonomoously download other bigger Whisper models through a dropdown.
However there's an option to select an external model file if you have it on disk.

Get more models from https://ggml.ggerganov.com/ and follow [the instructions on whisper.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp/tree/master/models) to create your own models or download others such as distilled models.

## Building

The plugin was built and tested on Mac OSX  (Intel & Apple silicon), Windows (with and without Nvidia CUDA) and Linux.

Start by cloning this repo to a directory of your choice.

### Mac OSX

Using the CI pipeline scripts, locally you would just call the zsh script, which builds for the architecture specified in $MACOS_ARCH (either `x86_64` or `arm64`).

```sh
$ MACOS_ARCH="x86_64" ./.github/scripts/build-macos -c Release
```

#### Install
The above script should succeed and the plugin files (e.g. `obs-localvocal.plugin`) will reside in the `./release/Release` folder off of the root. Copy the `.plugin` file to the OBS directory e.g. `~/Library/Application Support/obs-studio/plugins`.

To get `.pkg` installer file, run for example
```sh
$ ./.github/scripts/package-macos -c Release
```
(Note that maybe the outputs will be in the `Release` folder and not the `install` folder like `pakage-macos` expects, so you will need to rename the folder from `build_x86_64/Release` to `build_x86_64/install`)

### Linux (Ubuntu)

For successfully building on linux, first clone the repo, then from the repo directory:
```sh
$ sudo apt install -y libssl-dev
$ ./.github/scripts/build-linux
```

Copy the results to the standard OBS folders on Ubuntu
```sh
$ sudo cp -R release/RelWithDebInfo/lib/* /usr/lib/
$ sudo cp -R release/RelWithDebInfo/share/* /usr/share/
```
Note: The official [OBS plugins guide](https://obsproject.com/kb/plugins-guide) recommends adding plugins to the `~/.config/obs-studio/plugins` folder. This has to do with the way you *installed* OBS.

In case the above doesn't work, attempt to copy the files to the `~/.config` folder:
```sh
$ mkdir -p ~/.config/obs-studio/plugins/obs-localvocal/bin/64bit
$ cp -R release/RelWithDebInfo/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/obs-plugins/* ~/.config/obs-studio/plugins/obs-localvocal/bin/64bit/
$ mkdir -p ~/.config/obs-studio/plugins/obs-localvocal/data
$ cp -R release/RelWithDebInfo/share/obs/obs-plugins/obs-localvocal/* ~/.config/obs-studio/plugins/obs-localvocal/data/
```

### Windows

Use the CI scripts again, for example:

```powershell
> .github/scripts/Build-Windows.ps1 -Configuration Release
```

The build should exist in the `./release` folder off the root. You can manually install the files in the OBS directory.

```powershell
> Copy-Item -Recurse -Force "release\Release\*" -Destination "C:\Program Files\obs-studio\"
```

#### Building with CUDA support on Windows

LocalVocal will now build with CUDA support automatically through a prebuilt binary of Whisper.cpp from https://github.com/occ-ai/occ-ai-dep-whispercpp. The CMake scripts will download all necessary files.

To build with cuda add `CPU_OR_CUDA` as an environment variable (with `cpu`, `12.2.0` or `11.8.0`) and build regularly

```powershell
> $env:CPU_OR_CUDA="12.2.0"
> .github/scripts/Build-Windows.ps1 -Configuration Release
```
