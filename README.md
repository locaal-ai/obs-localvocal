## Introduction

LocalVocal live-streaming AI assistant plugin allows you to transcribe, locally on your machine, audio speech into text and perform various language processing functions on the text using AI / LLMs (Large Language Models). ‚úÖ No GPU required, ‚úÖ no cloud costs, ‚úÖ no network and ‚úÖ no downtime! Privacy first - all data stays on your machine.

If this free plugin has been valuable to you consider adding a ‚≠ê to this GH repo, rating it [on OBS](https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/localvocal-live-stream-ai-assistant.1769/), subscribing to [my YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@royshilk) where I post updates, and supporting my work: https://github.com/sponsors/royshil

Do more with LocalVocal:
- [Translate Caption any Application](https://youtu.be/qen7NC8kbEQ)
- [Real-time Translation with DeepL](https://youtu.be/ryWBIEmVka4)
- [POST Captions to YouTube](https://youtu.be/E7HKbO6CP_c)
- [Local LLM Real-time Translation](https://youtu.be/ZMNILPWDkDw)

Current Features:
- Transcribe audio to text in real time in 100 languages
- Display captions on screen using text sources
- Send captions to a file (which can be read by external sources)
- Send captions on a RTMP stream to e.g. YouTube, Twitch
- Bring your own Whisper model (GGML)
- Translate captions in real time to major languages

Roadmap:
- Remove unwanted words from the transcription
- Summarize the text and show "highlights" on screen
- Detect key moments in the stream and allow triggering events (like replay)
- Detect emotions/sentiment and allow triggering events (like changing the scene or colors etc.)

Internally the plugin is running a neural network ([OpenAI Whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper)) locally to predict in real time the speech and provide captions.

It's using the [Whisper.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp) project from [ggerganov](https://github.com/ggerganov) to run the Whisper network in a very efficient way on CPUs and GPUs.

Check out our other plugins:
- [Background Removal](https://github.com/occ-ai/obs-backgroundremoval) removes background from webcam without a green screen.
- üöß Experimental üöß [CleanStream](https://github.com/occ-ai/obs-cleanstream) for real-time filler word (uh,um) and profanity removal from live audio stream
- [URL/API Source](https://github.com/occ-ai/obs-urlsource) that allows fetching live data from an API and displaying it in OBS.
- [Polyglot](https://github.com/occ-ai/obs-polyglot) translation AI plugin for real-time, local translation to hunderds of languages

## Download
Check out the [latest releases](https://github.com/occ-ai/obs-localvocal/releases) for downloads and install instructions.

### Models
The plugin ships with the Tiny.en model, and will autonomoously download other bigger Whisper models through a dropdown.
However there's an option to select an external model file if you have it on disk.

Get more models from https://ggml.ggerganov.com/ and follow [the instructions on whisper.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp/tree/master/models) to create your own models or download others such as distilled models.

## Building

The plugin was built and tested on Mac OSX  (Intel & Apple silicon), Windows and Linux.

Start by cloning this repo to a directory of your choice.

Remember to sync and fetch the submodules before building, e.g.
```sh
$ git submodule sync --recursive
$ git update --init --recursive
```

### Mac OSX

Using the CI pipeline scripts, locally you would just call the zsh script. By default this builds a universal binary for both Intel and Apple Silicon. To build for a specific architecture please see `.github/scripts/.build.zsh` for the `-arch` options.

```sh
$ ./.github/scripts/build-macos -c Release
```

#### Install
The above script should succeed and the plugin files (e.g. `obs-urlsource.plugin`) will reside in the `./release/Release` folder off of the root. Copy the `.plugin` file to the OBS directory e.g. `~/Library/Application Support/obs-studio/plugins`.

To get `.pkg` installer file, run for example
```sh
$ ./.github/scripts/package-macos -c Release
```
(Note that maybe the outputs will be in the `Release` folder and not the `install` folder like `pakage-macos` expects, so you will need to rename the folder from `build_x86_64/Release` to `build_x86_64/install`)

### Linux (Ubuntu)

Use the CI scripts again
```sh
$ ./.github/scripts/build-linux.sh
```

Copy the results to the standard OBS folders on Ubuntu
```sh
$ sudo cp -R release/RelWithDebInfo/lib/* /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/
$ sudo cp -R release/RelWithDebInfo/share/* /usr/share/
```
Note: The official [OBS plugins guide](https://obsproject.com/kb/plugins-guide) recommends adding plugins to the `~/.config/obs-studio/plugins` folder.

### Windows

Use the CI scripts again, for example:

```powershell
> .github/scripts/Build-Windows.ps1 -Target x64 -CMakeGenerator "Visual Studio 17 2022"
```

The build should exist in the `./release` folder off the root. You can manually install the files in the OBS directory.

#### Building with CUDA support on Windows

To build with CUDA support on Windows, you need to install the CUDA toolkit from NVIDIA. The CUDA toolkit is available for download from [here](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads).

After installing the CUDA toolkit, you need to set variables to point CMake to the CUDA toolkit installation directory. For example, if you have installed the CUDA toolkit in `C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v11.4`, you need to set `CUDA_TOOLKIT_ROOT_DIR` to `C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v11.4` and `LOCALVOCAL_WITH_CUDA` to `ON` when running `.github/scripts/Build-Windows.ps1`.

For example
```powershell
.github/scripts/Build-Windows.ps1 -Target x64 -ExtraCmakeArgs '-D','LOCALVOCAL_WITH_CUDA=ON','-D',"CUDA_TOOLKIT_ROOT_DIR='C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v12.2'"
```

You will need to copy a few CUDA .dll files to the location of the plugin .dll for it to run. The required .dll files from CUDA (which are located in the `bin` folder of the CUDA toolkit installation directory) are:

- `cudart64_NN.dll`
- `cublas64_NN.dll`
- `cublasLt64_NN.dll`

where `NN` is the CUDA major version number. For example, if you have installed CUDA 12.2 as in example above, then `NN` is `12`.
